== Setup

TIP: Some steps of this workshop are made through the OpenShift Console (UI), some others through the oc command. So you should be logged into the two of thems.

=== OpenShift and CCFD project

First, create a project for this demo. We will use *ccfd* (Credit Card Fraud Detection). 

WARNING: All the commands and configuration files used in the workshop are using this project name, `ccfd`. If you use another one, please amend the commands and files as necessary.

You can create it through the Console, or with this command:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-project ccfd
----

=== Open Data Hub

==== Operator

Using the OpenShift Console UI, the Open Data Hub (ODH) operator can be deployed through the steps described https://opendatahub.io/docs/getting-started/quick-installation.html[here].

If you prefer to use the CLI, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/odh/operator.yaml
----

After a few seconds, you can check the operator installation with:
[source,bash]
----
oc get crd kfdefs.kfdef.apps.kubeflow.org
----
which should return:
[source,bash]
----
NAME                             CREATED AT
kfdefs.kfdef.apps.kubeflow.org   xxxxxxxxxxxx
----


==== Deploy ODH

Now that the operator is running, we can deploy our instance of ODH in our `ccfd` project. This deployment will include:

- Kafka
- Seldon
- Prometheus
- Grafana

WARNING: the Open Data Hub (ODH) operator can deploy the Strimzi operator that will handle the deployment of the Kafka cluster. However, *if Strimzi or AMQ Streams are already present on your cluster*, deploying it again may create issues. Therefore, 2 different versions of the ODH deployment are provided, with or without the Strimzi operator deployment. Choose according to your configuration.

.If you don't already have the Strimzi operator or AMQ Streams
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/odh/odh-with-strimzi.yaml
----

.If you don't need to deploy the Strimzi operator (you already have it or AMQ Streams)
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/odh/odh-no-strimzi.yaml
----

=== Rook-Ceph

https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/v1.4/[Rook-Ceph] is the solution that will provide *Object Storage* to store some data used in the workshop. +
These steps will deploy Rook-Ceph at version v1.4.7

.Create namespace, CRDs, Accounts and Security items
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/raw/a123405d6796435800f21f098dfceff8526e2339/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/common.yaml
----

.Deploy the operator
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/raw/a123405d6796435800f21f098dfceff8526e2339/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/operator-openshift.yaml
----

The next command to create the rook-ceph cluster itself is valid only for AWS deployments (so also RHPDS and OpenTLC environments).

.Deploy the rook-ceph cluster on AWS (including RHPDS or OpenTLC environments)
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/raw/a123405d6796435800f21f098dfceff8526e2339/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/cluster-on-pvc.yaml
----

TIP: If you are not running on AWS, you must adapt https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/v1.4.7/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/cluster.yaml[this file] to your configuration before applying it.

The rook-ceph cluster will take a few minutes to deploy. You can monitor the deployment in the `rook-ceph` namespace and wait to have 3 pods named osd running:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n rook-ceph
----

Once the Ceph cluster is ready, you can create the Object Store:

.Deploy the Object Store
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/raw/a123405d6796435800f21f098dfceff8526e2339/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/object.yaml
----

To acces the object store, you must create a route to the rook service, `rook-ceph-rgw-my-store` (in the rook-ceph namespace) to expose the endpoint. This endpoint url will be used to access the S3 interface from the example notebooks.

.Create the route
[source,bash]
----
oc expose -n rook-ceph --name='s3' svc/rook-ceph-rgw-my-store
----

Your Route will be in the form http://s3-rook-ceph.apps.<Name_of_your_cluster>

Create also the Bucket Storage Class, which will allow easy provisioning of buckets later on.

.Create the Storage Class
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f https://github.com/rook/rook/raw/a123405d6796435800f21f098dfceff8526e2339/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/storageclass-bucket-delete.yaml
----

=== Fraud detection model

We already have trained a fraud detection model that you can deploy by using `deploy/model/modelfull.yaml` in this repository:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/model/modelfull.yaml
----

Check and make sure the model is created (this step will take a couple of minutes):

[source,bash]
----
oc -n ccfd get seldondeployments
oc -n ccfd get pods | grep modelfull
----

You should have a pod named `modelfull-modelfull-0-modelfull-xxxxxxxxx` with the Running status, and 2/2 pods.

Create a route to the model by using `deploy/model/modelfull-route.yaml` in this repo:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/model/modelfull-route.yaml
----

Enable Prometheus metrics scraping by deploying a Service Monitor for the created service:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/model/modelfull-servicemonitor.yaml
----

=== Upload data to Rook-Ceph

==== Bucket creation though Object Bucket Claims

We will store our base data in an Object Store bucket. There are many ways to do it, but here is a method using an Object Bucket Claim. With Rook-Ceph that we deployed earlier, you can use this configuration.

.Create bucket with Rook-Ceph
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n ccfd -f deploy/storage/obc-rook.yaml
----

You can now retrieve the informations needed to connect to the storage. +

You can find this information through the OCP console, in the "Config Maps" and "Secrets" sections for the `ccfd` (selecting ccdata and clicking on "Reveal values"), or do this through the CLI:

.Access Key
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d - 
----

.Secret Key
[source,bash]
----
oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d - 
----

.Bucket name
[source,bash]
----
oc get cm/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]BUCKET_NAME | awk '{print $2}'
----

.Host (Internal access)
[source,bash]
----
oc get cm/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]BUCKET_HOST | awk '{print $2}'
----

.Host (External access)
[source,bash]
----
echo http://$(oc get -n rook-ceph route/s3 -o yaml | grep -m 1 '[^\-] host:' | awk '{print $2}')
----

==== Create a Secret to store your keys

This secret will be used later on by the pods that need access to S3, like the Kafka Producer.

[source,bash]
----
oc create secret generic keysecret -n ccfd --from-literal='accesskey=<Replace with Access Key>' --from-literal='secretkey=<Replace with Secret Key>'
----

TIP: If you have created your bucket through an Object Bucket Claim you can directly do this in one line:

[source,bash]
----
oc create secret generic keysecret -n ccfd --from-literal="accesskey=$(oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d -)" --from-literal="secretkey=$(oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d -)"
----


==== Upload data to your S3 bucket

Now that you have all the necessary information, you can upload data to your newly created bucket. Again, there are many ways to do that, but here is an example using the https://github.com/aws/aws-cli[aws client].

If you don't have the aws client already you can install it from https://github.com/aws/aws-cli[here].

.Method 1: Configure manually the client (Only enter key and secret, leave all other fields as default)
[source,bash]
----
aws configure
----

.Method 2: One line configuration
[source,bash]
----
aws configure set aws_access_key_id $(oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d -) & aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $(oc get secret/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | awk '{print $2}' | base64 -d -)
----

.Check if connection is working using the route (you can use oc get route -n rook-ceph):
[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url <S3_ENDPOINT_URL>
----

.or directly:
[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url http://$(oc get -n rook-ceph route/s3 -o yaml | grep -m 1 '[^\-] host:' | awk '{print $2}')
----

WARNING: For the previous command and all others using the aws client: if your endpoint is using SSL (starts with https) but your OpenShift installation has not been done with recognized certificates, you must add `--no-verify-ssl` at the end of all your commands.

.Copy the credit card transaction creditcard.csv file (available https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.redhat.csds.odh.tutorial-data/data_creditcard.csv[here]) and upload it using (replace < > vars):
[source,bash]
----
wget -qO- https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.redhat.csds.odh.tutorial-data/data_creditcard.csv | aws s3 cp - --endpoint-url <S3_ENDPOINT_URL> s3://<s3_bucket>/OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv --acl public-read-write
----

e.g.: `wget -qO- https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.redhat.csds.odh.tutorial-data/data_creditcard.csv | aws s3 cp - --endpoint-url https://s3-rook-ceph.apps.perf3.ocs.lab.eng.blr.redhat.com s3://ccdata-5a225950-c53c-4f10-af42-f49c3c29d03a/OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv --acl public-read-write`

TIP: You can do this in one (long...) command by using all the commands we've seen previously in substitution mode:

[source,bash]
----
wget -qO- https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.redhat.csds.odh.tutorial-data/data_creditcard.csv | aws s3 cp - --endpoint-url http://$(oc get -n rook-ceph route/s3 -o yaml | grep -m 1 '[^\-] host:' | awk '{print $2}') s3://$(oc get -n ccfd cm/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]BUCKET_NAME | awk '{print $2}')/OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv --acl public-read-write
----

.You can verify the file is uploaded using:
[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls s3://<s3_bucket>/OPEN/uploaded/ --endpoint-url <ROOK_CEPH_URL>
----

.Or with one line again:
[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls s3://$(oc get -n ccfd cm/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]BUCKET_NAME | awk '{print $2}')/OPEN/uploaded/ --endpoint-url http://$(oc get -n rook-ceph route/s3 -o yaml | grep -m 1 '[^\-] host:' | awk '{print $2}')
----

Both commands flavours should return:
----
XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX  150259138 creditcard.csv
----

=== KIE Server

==== Seldon model for the prediction service

In order to use jBPM's prediction service from User Tasks, a second Seldon model must be deployed using:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app quay.io/odh-workshops/ccfd-business-workflow-tutorial-ccfd-seldon-usertask-model:1.1-CCFD
----

==== Execution server

To deploy the KIE server you can use the deploy/ccd-service.yaml on this repo and run:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/ccd-service.yaml -n ccfd
----

The KIE server can be configured by editing the enviroment variables in that file, under the env key.
Some configurable values are:


SELDON_URL, location the Seldon server providing fraudulent score prediction

CUSTOMER_NOTIFICATION_TOPIC, Kafka topic for outgoing customer notifications

BROKER_URL, Kafka broker location and port


==== Execution server optional configuration
If the Seldon server requires an authentication token, this can be passed to the KIE server by adding the following environment variable to deploy/ccd-service.yaml:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: SELDON_TOKEN
  value: <SELDON_TOKEN>
----

By default, the KIE server will request a prediction to the endpoint <SELDON_URL>/predict. If however, your Seldon deployment uses another prediction endpoint, you can specify it by adding the SELDON_ENDPOINT enviroment variable, for instance:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: SELDON_ENDPOINT
  value: 'api/v0.1/predictions'
----

The HTTP connection parameters can also be configured, namely the connection pool size and the connections timeout. The timeout value provided is treated as milliseconds. For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: SELDON_TIMEOUT
  value: '5000' # five second timeout
- name: SELDON_POOL_SIZE
  value: '5' # allows for 5 simulataneous HTTP connections
----

The prediction service's confidence threshold, above which a prediction automatically assigns an output and
closes the user task can be also provided. It is assumed to be a probability value between 0.0 and 1.0.
If not provided, the default value is 1.0. To specify it use:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
  value: '0.5' # as an example
----

If you want to interact with the KIE server's REST interface from outside OpenShift, you can expose its service with

[source,bash]
----
oc expose svc/ccd-service
----

=== Notification service

The notification service is an event-driven micro-service responsible for relaying notifications to the customer and customer responses.

If a message is sent to a "customer outgoing" Kafka topic, a notification is sent to the customer asking whether the transaction was legitimate or not. For this demo, the micro-service simulates customer interaction, but different communication methods can be built on top of it (email, SMS, etc).

If the customer replies (in both scenarios: they either made the transaction or not), a message is written to a "customer response" topic. The router (described below) subscribes to messages in this topic, and signals the business process with the customer response.
To deploy the notification service, we use the image ccfd-notification-service (available https://quay.io/repository/odh-workshops/ccfd-business-workflow-tutorial-ccfd-notification-service[here]), by running:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/notification-service.yaml -n ccfd
----

==== Camel router

The https://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] router is responsible consume messages arriving in specific topics, requesting a prediction to the Seldon model, and then triggering different REST endpoints according to that prediction.

The route is selected by executing configurable https://www.drools.org/[Drools] rules using the model's prediction as inout. Depending rules outcome a specific business process will be triggered on the KIE server.

To deploy a router with listens to the topic KAFKA_TOPIC from Kafka's broker BROKER_URL and starts a process instance on the KIE server at KIE_SERVER_URL, we can use the built image ccd-fuse (available https://quay.io/repository/odh-workshops/ccfd-business-workflow-tutorial-ccd-fuse[here]):

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/router.yaml -n ccfd
----

==== Kafka Producer

The Kafka Producer needs specific parameters to read from S3 interface and call the model's REST prediction endpoint. +

We will use a template to deploy multiple objects at once. You can either edit the parameters in the `deploy/kafka/producer-deployment.yaml` in this repository before processing the template, or pass the parameters direcly. The needed parameters are:

- NAMESPACE: The OpenShift project in use, normally `ccfd`
- S3ENDPOINT: The address of your S3 storage, you should use the internal cluster address (normally s3.openshift-storage.svc)
- S3BUCKET: The name of the bucket created earlier
- FILENAME: The location of hte `creditcard.csv` file in the data store (nornmaly OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv)

.If you have directly modified the producer-deployment.yaml file
[source,bash]
----
oc process -f deploy/kafka/producer-deployment.yaml | oc apply -f -
----

.If you are passing the parameters
[source,bash]
----
oc process -f deploy/kafka/producer-deployment.yaml -p NAMESPACE=<Replace Namespace> -p S3ENDPOINT=<Replace Endpoint> -p S3BUCKET=<Replace Bucket> -p FILENAME=<Replace Filename> | oc apply -f -
----

e.g.: `oc process -f deploy/kafka/producer-deployment.yaml -p NAMESPACE=ccfd -p S3ENDPOINT=http://s3.openshift-storage.svc -p S3BUCKET=ccdata-5a225950-c53c-4f10-af42-f49c3c29d03a -p FILENAME=OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv | oc apply -f -`

.Automated one-line version
[source,bash]
----
oc process -f deploy/kafka/producer-deployment.yaml -p NAMESPACE=ccfd -p S3ENDPOINT=http://$(oc get -n rook-ceph route/s3 -o yaml | grep -m 1 '[^\-] host:' | awk '{print $2}') -p S3BUCKET=$(oc get -n ccfd cm/ccdata -o yaml | grep [^:]BUCKET_NAME | awk '{print $2}') -p FILENAME=OPEN/uploaded/creditcard.csv | oc apply -f -
----

==== Grafana/Prometheus

From the Openshift portal click on the Prometheus route and explore some of the metrics. +
To launch Grafana dashboard click on the Grafana route.

On top of the Kafka monitoring dashbord, you can deploy the following ones:

.Seldon Core
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/grafana/seldon-dashboard.yaml
----
